Description: The purpose of this package is the stability analysis for pesistent homology considering a filtration generated by Lazy Witness complexes. It will consider as stability measure, the difference between the betti numbers calculated on top of: i) the Lazy Witness complex formed from a data input X with a set L of landmarks and ii) the Lazy Witness complex built from a data perturbation X', which is given by the inclusion of new samples produced by the same i.i.d. probability distribution and underlying topology of X. This measure is defined over each radius employed in Lazy Witness in order to allow the identification of the stable complexes associated with those radius.
